      General Strike US (GSUS) Subpoena Policy / Attorney Tips
    </h1>

    <p class="date text-center">Last Revised: March 5, 2025</p>

    <p>
      GSUS's Privacy Policy prohibits the release of customer or account
      information without express permission from the customer, except when
      required by law, to conform to the edicts of the law, or to comply with
      legal process properly served on GSUS or one of its partners.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you seek the identity or account information of a GSUS member in
      connection with a civil or criminal legal matter, you must fax, mail, or
      serve GSUS with a valid subpoena. For criminal matters, you must be a
      member of the law enforcement community.
    </p>

    <h2>Submission of Subpoenas</h2>

    <p>
      GSUS is a decentralized network with no paid organizers or staff.
      Subpoenas can be mailed to our volunteers:
    </p>

    <address class="ms-4">
      General Strike US (GSUS)<br />
      PO Box 7<br />
      Malden-on-Hudson,<br />
      NY 12453
    </address>

    <h2>Policies Regarding E-mail</h2>
    <p>
      GSUS will not produce the content of e-mail, as the Electronic
      Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง2701 et seq., prohibits an
      electronic communications service provider from producing the contents of
      electronic communications, even pursuant to subpoena or court order,
      except in limited circumstances. GSUS's e-mail servers do not retain
      deleted or sent e-mail.
    </p>

    <p>
      GSUS reserves the right to request a copy of the complaint and any
      supporting documentation that demonstrates how the GSUS e-mail address is
      related to the pending litigation and the underlying subpoena.
    </p>

    <h2>Terms Specific to Civil Subpoenas:</h2>
      <h3>Notice to Customer and Response Time</h3>

      <p>
        Upon the receipt of a valid civil subpoena, GSUS will promptly notify
        the customer whose information is sought via e-mail or U.S. mail. If the
        circumstances do not amount to an emergency, GSUS will not immediately
        produce the customer information sought by the subpoena and will provide
        the customer an opportunity to move to quash the subpoena in court. GSUS
        reserves the right to charge an administration fee to the customer by
        charging the Payment Method the customer has on file with GSUS.
      </p>

      <h3>Fees for Subpoena Compliance</h3>

      <p>
        GSUS will charge the person or entity submitting the civil subpoena for
        costs associated with subpoena compliance. Payment must be made within
        thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the GSUS invoice. Checks
        should be made out to General Strike US.
      </p>

      <p>GSUS's subpoena compliance costs are as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Research - $75.00/hour</li>
        <li>Federal Express - Cost as Billed</li>
        <li>Copies - $0.25/page</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Treatment of Confidential Information</h3>

      <p>
        Documents and information produced by GSUS in response to a subpoena may
        contain confidential, proprietary, trade secret, and/or private
        information that warrants special protection from public disclosure. Any
        such documents will be designated "CONFIDENTIAL" by a stamp affixed to
        the documents at issue, and must be given confidential treatment by all
        persons and entities that access them. Confidential treatment includes
        the following:
      </p>

      <p>
        First, access to CONFIDENTIAL documents must be limited to the parties
        in the underlying action pursuant to which the subpoena was served,
        their agents, and the court and its personnel. Documents designated as
        CONFIDENTIAL may be used during the deposition of a witness in the
        underlying action to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary, provided
        that any deposition testimony related to CONFIDENTIAL documents or
        portions thereof is designated "CONFIDENTIAL" and afforded treatment in
        the manner required by this provision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, CONFIDENTIAL documents must not be filed in the public record
        absent a reasonable attempt to ensure the filing of such documents, and
        any references thereto, under seal. A party that seeks to file any
        motion, brief, or other document that attaches or refers to any
        CONFIDENTIAL document or portion thereof must take the steps necessary
        to request a court order sealing the CONFIDENTIAL information at issue.
        If the court denies a motion to seal made pursuant to this Subpoena
        Policy, the party may file the document(s) at issue normally, unless
        otherwise instructed by the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third, CONFIDENTIAL documents produced in response to a subpoena may not
        be used for any purpose other than prosecuting or defending the action
        in which the subpoena is served, and must be destroyed within sixty (60)
        days after the final disposition of the underlying action. The person or
        entity that submits the subpoena is responsible for ensuring that each
        person or entity to whom any CONFIDENTIAL documents were made available
        complies with this requirement.
